OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Quakemonkey is an implementation of the snapshot protocol used in the successful Quake 3 engine, built on top of the existing jMonkeyEngine networking framework. \
    In short, this UDP-only protocol sends partial messages to each client in order to save bandwidth. \
    These partials are created from the difference at byte level of the current message and the message that was last received by the client.\n\n\
    Quakemonkey makes your life easier, because you don\u2019t have to figure out for yourself which values in your gamestate have changed and create partial messages for each to save bandwidth. \
    You can just send a big gamestate message, and quakemonkey will take care of the rest.
